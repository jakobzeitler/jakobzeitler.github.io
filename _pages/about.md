I research methods and limitations of causal inference and their intersection with machine learning.

I believe that causal inference can work in the real world only if we are <strong>honest about its assumptions</strong>. That is why I am looking at problem settings with trustworthy properties:
<ul>
<li>
 <a href="http://partial-identification.com">Partial identification</a> is a very attractive alternative to full identification due to weaker assumptions. 
</li>

<li>New directions such as <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/aglietti20a/aglietti20a.pdf">Causal Bayesian Optimisation</a> or <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/shi22b.html">Synthetic Control</a> will play a crucial role in the future. 
</li>

<li>
I also find <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/2c463dfdde588f3bfc60d53118c10d6b-Paper.pdf">topological perspectives</a> on causal inference particularly useful for understanding limits of causal inference.
</li>
</ul>
